Hello!
This is the souce code of my team's project for REVA HACK 2023

"MED BUDDY" is a Disease Predicting Web Application integracted with chatbot. It is an AI ML model. It aims to redefine healthcare with a personalized touch.

- It is trained with five disease prediction models, targeting cardiovascular disease, skin disease, diabetes, ocular disease, and heart disease, with a focus on early detection and prevention.

- It is developed with an innovative FAQ-style bot using OpenAI's Text-DaVinci-003 model. This bot efficiently answers health-related questions and provides valuable information to users.

- All components are integrated using Streamlit, resulting in a user-friendly health dashboard that allows us to collect patient data efficiently.
